History:
Yogurt was invented in 5000 B.C. and the combination of yogurt and honey was called "the food of the Gods."
The myth of the Griffin probably began when fossils of Protoceratops skulls were found in gold mines near ancient Greece.
There was a copper scroll found among the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1952 that is not a literary work like the others. Instead, it lists the locations of valuable treasures such as silver and gold that have been buried or hidden.
The Woolsey Hall auditorium at Yale contains an extra-wide seat built to fit alumnus and former professor William Howard Taft.
One of the more humorous things about the American Revolutionary era is that almost every single Founding Father were worse at managing personal finances than the average American is today (yes, it was that bad).
In 1719 prisoners in Paris were offered freedom at the condition that they would marry a prostitute and move to Louisiana.

By 1790, they had all amassed a crazy amount of debt, a lot of it was on extreme extravagances, like Washington ordering marble from Italy for his new fireplace or ordering green wallpaper (the most expensive color in the 18th century) from Northern Europe. Jefferson would reportedly spend $800 a day (in today's dollars) on groceries while he was in the White House, a large portion of that was on wine. He also constantly renovated Monticello, bought books on credit and loaned money to farmers. Many of them were simply drowning in debt and had no clear plans for getting themselves out of it.

A Neanderthal who is now named "Shanidar 1" was buried approximately 45,000 to 35,000 years ago. Despite several injuries and disabilities from early in his life that would have made it impossible to survive on his own, he lived to relatively old age (40 to 50) with the help of others.
